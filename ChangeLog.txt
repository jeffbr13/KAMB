7.3.2013 - Atanas

- First of all made this changelog since I did too many changes to list them all in the commit;

- Fixed planets going out of the window's boarder. This involves Universe choosing a random radius
when generating a planet;

- Fixed the Planet class not knowing what the min and max value for the planets the Universe class has,
this also involved writing a public getMinPlanetSize() and getMaxPlanetSize() for Universe;

- Fixed a small bug with the Planet class that made it calculate a slightly smaller distance between 2
planets than it was supposed to.

- Put the manual generation of 3 planets in the Game class in a comment since they clash with
other randomly generated planets (feel free to change that back);

- Changed the number of planets it generated in the start, the distance between them and their max size to show that it
actually works. The number of planets or distance might need to be reduced if running it in lower resolution (feel free
to change that too, but make sure that the planets will be able to fit with the distance or size you choose).









28.3.2013 - Atanas

Fleet class:

- Added Planet target to the Fleet class that represents the planet the fleet is send to;

- Added getTarger(), getTarger(), getImage() and hasArrived()- the last one checks if the fleet is inside the target's radius;

- Made an alternative constructor for Fleets that has the target as imput instead of the attack coordinates.



Universe class

- Added deleteFleet() method to Universe.



Planet class:

- Added getSinglePlayer() method to Planet that returns a Player if he is the only one with ships on the planet in the moment.
If more than one players have ships on the planet or no players have ships there it returns null;

- Improvements to the Update() method in Planet;

- Fixed performCapture() method. It wasn't working before.

- Made performCapture() depend on the number of ships the Player has on the planet.



Game class

- Fixed fleets not drawing properly;

- Made it check after updating a fleet if that fleet has reached it's target and terminating it while adding the ships to the planet
if it has;

- Made the capture % show in the middle of planets.
