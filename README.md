TODO
----

Meeting on Saturday at 1400, in the West Lab.

* Remember: push (to GitHub) early, push often!
* Add short comments above each method, and sign them


### Matej

Make the graphics prettier!


### Atanas

Take charge of the Planet class, implementing the following:

* public Planet(int x, int y, int radius) // construct the planet, and
    ensure everything (including the image) is set up to be used  
--- Done... I think.

* public getImage() // get a drawable image of the planet  
--- Done.


### Kim

* Update Fleet class so that all necessary methods are public, and attributes have getters/setters if needed.
* Update Game class to use the right methods or getters and setters.


### Ben

Integrate the universe class with the Game object.
