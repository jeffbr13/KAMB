### Matej

Make the graphics prettier!


### Atanas

Take charge of the Planet class, implementing the following:

* public Planet(int x, int y, int radius) // construct the planet, and
    ensure everything (including the image) is set up to be used  
--- Done... I think.

* public getImage() // get a drawable image of the planet  
--- Done.


### Ben and Kim

Integrate the universe class with the Game object.
